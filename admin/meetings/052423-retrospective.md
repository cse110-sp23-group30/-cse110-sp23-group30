- We have some difficulties figuring out what to do.

### IV. Lessons Learned
- Assigning issues and tasks to a team member is very important, because each team member has different skills and interests.
- Some issues are harder than other issues, so it’s important to do standups to quickly address which team member needs assistance / more time.
- Github is powerful for group development - it’s very easy to split tasks into issues and branches.

### V. Action Items
!!! All actions items will be due at the end of Sprint 2.

- Instructions screen: make text and buttons larger, fill instruction list, correctly map buttons back to respective screens

### VI. Discussion Points for Next Sprint
- Key topics or issues that need to be addressed in the next sprint: In sprint 1, we developed separate screens and need to find a way to link these screens together. Moreover, we just developed barebones pages and need better design for each screen.
- Also need to start utilizing localStorage.

### VII. Appreciations
Everybody in this group was able to complete their tasks on time. Any conflicts with merges were resolved efficiently and timely. Any problems with communication or design were dealt with and there was not any remaining animosity.
