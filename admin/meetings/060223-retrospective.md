### Agenda

- Sprint 2 Retrospective

### I. Sprint Goals

- Finish implementing most functionalities for the app, forming basic prototype.
- Work on UI.
- Some details are added to make sure the design is going in the right direction.

### II. What Went Well

- Some positives that went well with our sprint are that all the members were on top of their personal issues and branches and got their screens and linting finished properly and on time.
- We were able to hammer out a lot more aspects of what we want the end result to look at and some more aligning of screens and functionality.
- Practically, we were able to sort through issues that we were unsure of as well.
- As a group as well, we were able to meet up regularly for meetings and schedule around getting all the assignments and check inâ€™s done, despite many busy schedules and complications along the way.
- The team leaders are courteous and understanding in trying to accommodate people while still getting things done, and the members put in their best effort to show up consistently and get their work done.

### III. What Could Have Gone Better

- We have some difficulties when implementing certain features.
- We have some difficulties figuring out what to include in the final project.
- We faced some problems between incorporating different features.

### IV. Lessons Learned

- Maintain good communication while working on a sprint.
- Keep the pipeline up and running.

### V. Action Items

- Figure out a common style (font, CSS, static background image) to maintain uniform app.
- Ensure that there is a pipeline to follow so that users can play the game properly.

### VI. Discussion Points for Next Sprint

- Key topics or issues that need to be addressed in the next sprint: In sprint 2, we continued development on separate screens and did find a way to link these screens together. However, we still need to better design for each page and make sure each styling is consistent across every screen. Moreover, we also need to find a way to put the header on top of every screen and give it globalized properties.
- Started utilizing localStorage, but need to completely start using it (instead of just for a few things) to centralize our storage.

### VII. Appreciations

- Appreciation for everyone to show up for multiple meetings during the week despite being busy. Thanks to georgio for recording team meetings.
- Communication was very seamless this week.
