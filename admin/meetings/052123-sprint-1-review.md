### Discussion

During the meeting, we reviewed the progress made in Sprint 1 and were pleased with the successful completion of most of our planned objectives and user stories. We acknowledged minor challenges encountered but appreciated the team's collaboration in overcoming them. Lessons learned included the importance of effective communication, close collaboration, and proper planning. For Sprint 2, we discussed and set objectives, identified user stories, and allocated resources accordingly. We scheduled regular check-ins and stand-up meetings to ensure timely progress tracking and issue resolution. The next meeting was scheduled to review Sprint 2 progress and plan for subsequent sprints.

### Reviews

- Georgio: Created the bowl screen which allows users to customize their meals by selecting a base, protein, toppings, and sides. Implemented the necessary features, including creating div elements for each component, populating them with at least three "card-style" food selection items, and adding a button or section for users to order more items. I worked on the HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality to bring the bowl screen to life. The next steps include integrating the localStorage API, enhancing the user interface with images, dynamically updating the cart screen, and conducting user testing for a seamless user experience.
