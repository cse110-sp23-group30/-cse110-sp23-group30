### Discussion

During the meeting, we had an extensive discussion about the different screens of our app, focusing on their appearance and functionality. We wanted to ensure that our users have an enjoyable experience when using our app, and we recognized that the screens play a vital role in achieving that goal.

We discussed various ideas and suggestions for improving the screens, and we came to a consensus on the changes that we will make. We noted that some screens require minor changes, while others need significant revisions. However, we agreed that all screens should be aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly, and provide a seamless user experience.

In addition, we completed one Architecture Decision Record (ADR) related to the fortune cookie screen and user experience. We discussed different approaches to designing this screen and agreed on a final decision. We noted that the chosen design will enhance the user's interaction with our app and make it more engaging.

Lastly, we discussed the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) assignment. We recognized the importance of having a streamlined development process, and we identified the necessary steps to implement the CI/CD pipeline. We assigned team members to specific tasks and agreed to review our progress in the next meeting.

### To-Do

- Complete ADRs for the other screens
- Complete CI/CD pipeline assignment.
