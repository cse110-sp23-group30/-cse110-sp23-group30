### Discussion

During the meeting, we discussed a list of potential features for the Fortune Cookie App. Some of the features discussed include adding different ingredients with animations, customization of the fortune cookie, an animation of the cookie opening, and a bag opening animation. We also talked about adding sound effects such as music and cracking sounds. Another feature discussed was whether to make the fortune cookie more randomized or personalized, and the pros and cons of each option.

The team also brainstormed adding a restaurant table background image, gamification features like a day streak counter and secret menu, and Easter eggs like factory issues and order jokes. Additionally, we discussed the possibility of associating each ingredient with weights to output positivity/negativity and implementing a settings option.

The team also talked about implementing an ML API for personalized fortunes, daily streaks, and character backstories. We discussed various screens, including a start button modeled after Club Penguin, an instruction screen, a food selection screen, a fake payment screen, a fortune animation screen, a play-again screen, and a cookie fortune screen.

Overall, we discussed various ideas for features and functionalities that could be incorporated into the Fortune Cookie App, including the pros and cons of each. The team will further review the list to determine which features will be included in the MVP implementation.
