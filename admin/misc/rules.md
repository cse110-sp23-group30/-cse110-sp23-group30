# Team Working Agreement

__Purpose:__ The purpose of this team working agreement is to establish a shared understanding and set of guidelines that will help us work collaboratively and effectively towards our shared goals.

&nbsp;

__1. Primary Means of Communication and Expectations:__

All team members are expected to read Slack messages and emails from anyone in the group on a daily basis, and to respond to announcements promptly. Additionally, all members should fill out the daily stand-up form in Slack.

&nbsp;

__2. Weekly Meeting:__

We will hold weekly meetings every Sunday at 8:00 PM, via Zoom.

&nbsp;

__3. General Responsibilities for All Team Members:__

All team members are responsible for keeping communication lines open and transparent, and for notifying the group about any issues or problems that they may be facing. Additionally, each member should be responsible for completing their assigned tasks on time.

&nbsp;

__4. Conflict Resolution:__

The team has a collective responsibility to help any member who may fall behind on their tasks, so that they can get back on track. We believe in an "all for one, one for all" approach to conflict resolution.

&nbsp;

__5. Expectations of Faculty and TA's:__

If a team member fails to meet the expectations outlined in this agreement, the situation should be reported to the staff. However, the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. The staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve any issues that may arise.
