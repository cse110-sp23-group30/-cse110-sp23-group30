# Use an instruction screen or pop-up for guidance for the fortune cookie

## Context and Problem Statement

At the beginning of trying to build the order to get the fortune cookie, how should we make the activity more accessible for those who want to play. We want to make it simplistic but also comprehensive enough to explain how to play.

## Considered Options

### How to implement_

- A whole page inbetween start page and first page
- A pop-up over the first page
  - Adding a button to bring up the pop-up whenever the player wants

### What's on the page_

- A control diagram with just graphics
- Instruction sheet with just text
- A mix of both graphics and text

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "A pop-up over the first page" with "A mix of both graphics and text." We thought this would add a more accessible instruction sheet as the player could just bring the pop-up back up with a button somewhere on the screen, and the visuals and text would better explain what is going on - giving a more detailed explanation along with more clear cut graphics and signifiers on how to actually play.
