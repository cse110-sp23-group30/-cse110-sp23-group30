# ADR: Bluemoon Express designs

## Context and Problem Statement

So far, the game has five different screens, and we want to have unified designs over all screens to have a consistent and professional look.

## Considered Options

1. Including a comprehensive set of settings and features in the initial release, addressing various user preferences.
2. Leaving the setting panel mostly empty, focusing on essential functionalities, and utilizing it as an expansion opportunity for future releases.

## Decision Outcome

Create a centralized css to store the following:

- One background image to use
- One consistent font
- Opening, plate, bowl, cart screen should have unified button designs; Instruction and cookie screen should have unique designs.

## Alternatives

- Have unique background image for opening screen
- Use unified button for all screens

## Rationale

It is important to have the same background image since we want to establish the atmosphere for our game. Using different background images can interupt the user's experience.
Unified font is also needed for the user to not feel any abrupt changes during the playthrough.
Buttons should be unified in the opening screen and the food selection screen for the same reason above. Instruction screen should have unique button design since it isn't part of the main play though.
Cookie screen should also have an unique button since the screen is the most important one, and we want the user to experience a change in atmosphere to prepare them to read their fortune.
