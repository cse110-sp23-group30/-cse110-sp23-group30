# Use multiple clicks to render gradual cracking animation of the fortune cookie

## Context and Problem Statement

Once we have the fortune cookie, how do we make the user to crack the cookie to reveal the message inside?

## Considered Options

* Single click
* Drag to throw the cookie to use gravity to crack
* Multiple click
* Facial recognition - the angrier the face the more the cookie cracks
* Voice recognition - the louder the user shouts *OPEN SESAME* the more the cookie cracks

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Multiple click". It adds the interactive aspect of the game, and the gradual "cracking" is easy to implement while being realistic.
