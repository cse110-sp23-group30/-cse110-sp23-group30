# ADR: Setting Panel in the Fortune Teller App - Empty State and Expansion Opportunities

## Context and Problem Statement

In the development of our Fortune Teller app, we have included a setting panel to provide users with customizable options and preferences. Currently, the setting panel is relatively empty, containing only music sliders. The decision to leave it mostly empty was deliberate, as explained below.

## Considered Options

1. Including a comprehensive set of settings and features in the initial release, addressing various user preferences.
2. Leaving the setting panel mostly empty, focusing on essential functionalities, and utilizing it as an expansion opportunity for future releases.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Leaving the setting panel mostly empty for expansion.

## Rationale

We have intentionally decided to leave the setting panel in the Fortune Teller app mostly empty, with only music sliders, due to the following reasons:

1. Time Constraints: With the limited development timeframe, we prioritized building a stable and user-friendly app. Implementing a comprehensive set of settings and features would have required significant time and resources. By keeping the setting panel minimal, we were able to focus on delivering a functional app within the given timeframe.

2. Expansion Opportunities: The "emptiness" of the setting panel presents a significant opportunity for future expansion. By deliberately leaving it open, we acknowledge the importance of user customization and flexibility. In subsequent releases, we can introduce additional features such as dark/light mode toggles, global music/sound effect volume sliders, and language translation options to Chinese for more authenticity. These additions will enhance the user experience and allow users to tailor the app to their preferences.

3. Strategic Flexibility: By reserving the setting panel for future expansion, we maintain strategic flexibility. It allows us to do user testing and adapt the app based on actual user needs and demands. This approach ensures that the features included in the setting panel align closely with user expectations, resulting in a more refined and targeted experience.

By keeping the setting panel empty, except for the music sliders, we emphasize its significance for future expansion. While we recognize the potential value of additional settings and features, our initial focus was on delivering a functional app within the given timeframe. This decision provides us with the opportunity to enhance the app's customization options in subsequent releases, based on user feedback and preferences.

We understand that the empty state of the setting panel may appear limited at the moment. However, it serves as a foundation for future growth and evolution of the Blue Moon Express app. As we continue to iterate and improve the app, we will introduce additional features and settings in the setting panel, providing a more comprehensive and personalized user experience.
